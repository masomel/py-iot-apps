ANDY 2.0
=========

Meet Andy, a multi-purpose humanoid robot built with a Raspberry Pi and a quite a few other components. Andy can walk, take pictures, record video, and answer questions. Andy is voice controlled, so there is no need for a computer or smart phone to send him commands. Just say "Andy" wait for the beep, say your command, and Andy will do the rest.

Hardware
========

Andy is built out of inexpencive hardware, so no need for pocket loads of cash. A metal bracket biped is used for walking and moving. A Raspberry Pi is the brain of Andy, making him a very intelligent machine. A cheap USB microphone is plugged into the Raspberry Pi's USB socket giving Andy ears. Servos are used to give Andy motion.
Software
========

Andy uses many different software packages to operate. Pocketsphinx is used for speech recognition, OpenCV is used for the vision, MySQL is used for Andy's database, and Python is used to combine everything together.
