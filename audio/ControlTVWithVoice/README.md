# raspberrypi_voice_control

# Hardware requirements:
1. TV set with enabled [HDMI-CEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC) / Anynet+ (Samsung) - You'll have to check your own TV set and make sure that you enable the HDMI-CEC control.
2. Raspberry Pi - I recommend the [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1PNG54). For this tutorial, the Raspberry Pi should be connected to the TV set via HDMI.
3. USB microphone - I used [C-Media microphone USB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IR8R7WQ)
