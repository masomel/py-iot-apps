# home-ventilation-raspberry-pi
A home ventilation controller using Raspberry Pi that uses DS18B20 temperature sensors, DHT22 humidity sensors and WeMo Switches

There is a Arduino version as well.

The project is controlling the positive air pressure ventilation fan in the ceiling. The arduino is more robust, but controls the fan through a relay, something that is not legal here and will void our home insurance. The Raspberry Pi version uses a WeMo switch to make it legal.
